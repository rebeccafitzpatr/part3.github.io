        <h3>Week 1 Concept: solve the problem by halving it.</h3>
        <p>Efficiency of a strategy is determined by its worst performance. The running time of an algorithm are determined by number of elementary steps. And we usually consider the worst case, and sometime consider in expectation (or on average). Optimised algorithms should be efficient independent of the OS they run on. We need to cover sorting and searching algorithms, graph algorithms. Data structure - how to organise data in memory. Algorithm design techniques. Learning how to code is like learning the rules of chess. We are about to learn startegies that will make us better players.</p>
