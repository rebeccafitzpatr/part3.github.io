                <h2>Linguistic diversity</h2>
                <p>There are about 7000 estimated languages in the world, however it is hard to have a precise number due to the blur between a 'language' and a 'dialect'. This linguistic diversity is caused when human populations become isolated from their neighbours. </p>
                <p>Some regions are more linguistically diverse than others.</p><br/>
                <p>However diversity today is diminishing; the number of languages is always decreasing. This is especially as we find increased mobility and access to different areas of the would; people tend to aim to learn the most socioeconomically valuable variety of language. Furthermore, political messaging can lead to preconceived ideologies about language, which are poorly based.</p>

                <h2>SYNTAX - the study of the accepted order of words in a language's sentences (traditionally called grammar)</h2>
                <p>Languages have infinite potential for creativity and variation; this lends to the fact that language rules are not permanent. Furthermore syntax should not be confused with prescriptive rules or the assertion of what is 'proper' in grammar. Linguistic study is focused on how language is used, whether or not it is proper is not vital.</p>
                <br/> <p><b>Word Classes:</b> All words in any language are either open class or closed class</p>
